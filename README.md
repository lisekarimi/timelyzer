# 📊 Timelyzer

Time series analysis and forecasting with statistical and ML models

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using a variety of statistical and machine learning models. The aim is to analyze time series data from various domains, perform data preprocessing and visualization, apply different forecasting models, and compare their performances. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for each dataset.

## 🔑 Key Features
- EDA and data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Time series decomposition
- Model fitting
- Prediction generation
- Cross validation
- Model evaluation
- Models comparison

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Software:
    - Python 3.x
    - uv
    - Cloud-based or browser-based notebook environments (Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Notebooks, Google Colab ...)

- Skills:
    - Solid understanding of statistics, machine learning (ARIMA, Prophet, and modern deep learning models like Transformers and Temporal Fusion Transformers TFT)
    - Expetise in data preprocessing techniques (handling missing values, scaling, feature engineering).
    - Proficiency in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

## 🚀 Running the Notebooks
To run the notebooks locally:

1. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Open the notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, etc.)

3. Select the kernel that was created by `uv sync` (usually named `.venv` or `timelyzer`)

## 💡 Note
These notebooks will also be shared on Kaggle. To open a link in a new tab, hold CTRL (CMD) and click the link.
